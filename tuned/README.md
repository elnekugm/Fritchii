# Eglantine tuned

An experimental, unofficial Windows build of the Eglantine Nintendo Switch 2 emulator, tuned for Mario Kart World on a Ryzen 5 5500 with an RTX 3050 8 GB and 16 GB of RAM.

It is based on [zortos293/Eglantine build 31](https://github.com/zortos293/Eglantine/releases/tag/nx2-build31-20261101) (commit `badc91ebce`). That project builds on [Djihads80/Eglantine](https://github.com/Djihads80/Eglantine), Eden and yuzu. All credit for the emulator goes to those projects. This is not an official release of any of them, so please don't report problems with it to them.

## Download

Get the zip from the Releases page, extract it into its own folder, and run `eglantine.exe`. Settings are already built in, so you only need to add your keys and firmware and map your controller.

**You need:**

- A CPU that supports Zen 3 instructions. This build is compiled with `-march=znver3`, so it may crash on start on older AMD CPUs and many Intel CPUs. If that happens, use the official build 31 or build from source with your own flags.
- The latest [Microsoft Visual C++ x64 runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
- Your own legally dumped keys, firmware and games. None are included.

## What's different from build 31

| Change | Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GPU mapping table updates only compare the changed range | `nx2_gpu_mapping_table.h` | Matched the original over 2 million randomised operations, and ran about 160-240x faster per operation in a benchmark. That is not an fps figure. |
| Async draw check uses the current draw's real count | `draw_manager.cpp`, `maxwell_3d.h`, `vk_pipeline_cache.cpp` | The old check could read a stale count from the buffer the draw doesn't use. `EDEN_NX2_STALE_DRAW_COUNTS=1` restores it for comparison. |
| Logs draws waiting on a pipeline build | `vk_graphics_pipeline.cpp` | Diagnostics only. |
| Saves the PGO profile every 30 s in training builds | `src/yuzu/main.cpp` | Only compiled with `EGLANTINE_PGO_GENERATE`. |
| Tested settings are the defaults | `src/common/settings.h`, `src/core/game_settings.*` | Controller mappings aren't included. The Mario Kart World override was not run in a game before this release. |

The release is also built with Clang 23.1.4, ThinLTO, Zen 3 tuning and a profile trained on about 7 minutes of Mario Kart World.

## Launch flags

`nx2_switches.txt` beside the program sets `EDEN_NX2_UNSAFE_PREEMPTIVE_READS=1`, an unsafe shortcut that build 31's own README does not recommend by default. Delete that line if you get glitches. Unlike build 31's launcher, this build leaves the split GPU thread on, because the project's notes measured it at 1.46x throughput.

## Built-in settings

These are the program's defaults, in `src/common/settings.h`. They apply to all games, and Unsafe accuracy can break some Switch 1 titles, so change them in the emulator's settings or per game if something misbehaves. If you already have an Eden or Eglantine config, any settings you changed yourself stay as they are.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| GPU mode | Fast |
| DMA accuracy | Unsafe |
| GPU fence behaviour | Balanced (Immediate for Mario Kart World) |
| Scaling filter | ScaleForce |
| Memory layout | 8 GB (Switch 2 games always use 12 GB) |
| CPU accuracy | Unsafe |
| Asynchronous shaders | On |
| Asynchronous presentation | On |
| Disk shader cache | On |
| Driver pipeline cache | Off |
| Sync memory operations | Off |
| Reactive flushing | Off |
| VRAM usage mode | Aggressive |
| Resolution | 0.5x, handheld mode |

Turning sync memory operations off gave a black screen entering races on an older Eglantine build. It didn't on this one in testing, but if you get a black screen, turn it back on first.

## Test results

Tested on one PC only: Ryzen 5 5500, RTX 3050 8 GB, 16 GB RAM at 3600 MHz, Mario Kart World.

| Run | Median fps | Lowest 600-frame average |
|---|---|---|
| This build, sync memory on | 36.7 | 23.5 |
| This build, sync memory off | 42 | 24.2 |

The sync memory off run was short, so treat it as promising, not final. Heavy tracks can still drop while textures load, and this is not a locked 60 fps.

## Known problems

- The game can log a panic (for example 2162-0001 or 2010-0212) and may keep running in a broken state. The cause isn't fully known.
- Stopping a game can leave `eglantine.exe` running with no window, holding a lot of RAM. Check Task Manager before relaunching.
- Don't share your shader cache: `vulkan.bin` contains game code.

## Building from source

You need Visual Studio with the C++ tools, Clang 23, `glslangValidator` and `patch` on `PATH`. Edit the paths in the cache files in this folder to match your machine.

```bash
cmake -C tuned/pgo-use-cache.cmake -S . -B build/pgo-use -G Ninja
cmake --build build/pgo-use --target yuzu
```

To train your own profile, build with `tuned/pgo-gen-cache.cmake`, run with `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` set, play for a while, then merge the output with `llvm-profdata merge -o tuned/eglantine.profdata`. A profile trained on your own games and CPU should suit you better than the one included here.

## License and AI disclosure

GPL-3.0-or-later, the same as the projects it's based on. See `LICENSE.txt`.

The changes in this repo were written with Claude (Anthropic), then tested in-game by the repo owner. They have not been reviewed by the Eglantine developers.
